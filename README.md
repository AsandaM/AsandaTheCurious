### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- AsandahDevs is the name...ðŸ˜œ
- (â˜žï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž I'm a dude who admires web develeopment and all things related to UI/UX which sorts of makes me biased towards front-end web development...
- This is thanks to user friendly,aesthetically appealing and interactive online shopping ðŸ›’ sites such as Takealot(SA).
- JavaScript is what keeps me alive and awake at night. 
- languages I'm familiar with include HTML,CSS and SQL.
- If anyone is open for any front-end web development collaborations hit me up at noelmajola@gmail.com.
