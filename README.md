# Hi there 👋
 AsandahDevs is the name...😜
☞ ☞ I'm a dude whose passionate about web development especially all things related to UI/UX which sort of makes me biased towards front-end web development.
 JavaScript is a language i use on a regular basis.
 React.js <img width="15" alt="React logo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89397749/174078402-8b0cc0bf-87e9-485a-a988-c2c97b7450fb.png">  is my preferred JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces

## Programming languages i'm proficient in:
* HTML,
* CSS, 
* JavaScript 
*  SQL.

I guess you can label me as multi-lingual 🤷🏽‍♂️.
If anyone is open for any front-end web development collaborations hit me up at noelmajola@gmail.com.
